# NES Color Palette

### Hex values for the original NES Color Palette, stored as CSS Custom Properties.  

Omitted are the nine extra instances of #000000 that are on the actual NES palette.  

Hex value source: [Almighty Guru](http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Games/Hacking/Wiki/index.php/NES_Palette)  


I got the color names by searching the hex code at [Color About](https://www.colorabout.com/)
and selecting the closest match. Some colors were too close to each other and came up with the same name. In those instances I just made a judgement call.  

If any color afficionados really want to fix this up, feel free to hit me with a PR.
