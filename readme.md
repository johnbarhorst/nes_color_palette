# NES Color Palette

Hex values for the original NES Color Palette, according to 
http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Games/Hacking/Wiki/index.php/NES_Palette 

Omitted are the nine extra instances of #000000 that are on the actual NES palette.

I got the color names by searching the hex code at https://www.colorabout.com/
and selecting the closest match. Some colors were too close, and I had to make a 
judgement call.

If any color afficionados really want to fix this up, feel free to hit me with a PR.
